Smile, and the world smiles with you,
Knock and you go alone;
For the cheerful grin
Will let you in
Where the kicker is never known.

Growl, and the way looks dreary;
Laugh, and the path is bright,
For the welcome smile
Brings sunshine, while
A frown shuts out the light.

Sing, and the world's harmonious!
Grumble, and things go wrong.
Yet all the time
You are out of rhyme
With the busy, bustling throng.

Kick, and there's trouble brewing;
Whistle, and life is gay.
And the world's in tune
Like a day in June,
And sorrow will melt away.
